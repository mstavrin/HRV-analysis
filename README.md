HRV-analysis
============

A pack of programs for analysis of electrocardiographic datasets for extraction of Heart Rate Variability 
and its power spectrum analysis.

For the power spectrum four different methodologies have been used: 
a) Fourier
b) Welch periodogram (based on Fourier)
c) Burg autoregressive
d) Yulear autoregressive. 

The programs here were used in the paper:
