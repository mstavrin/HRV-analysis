HRV-analysis
============

A pack of programs for analysis of electrocardiographic datasets for extraction of Heart Rate Variability 
and its power spectrum analysis.

For the power spectrum four different methodologies have been used: 
a) Fourier
b) Welch periodogram (based on Fourier)
c) Burg autoregressive
d) Yulear autoregressive. 

Site the following paper if you are going to use, or modify and use the above programs:

Chroni, Methodological Issues in the spectral analysis of the heart rate variability: application in pa-tients with epilepsy, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, Vol. 13, pp. 1â€“7, 2014. 

The programs were also used in the paper:
